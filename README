---- About this program ----

This program encrypts/decrypts an input file into an output using a given key.

It is expected that the key is made of printable ASCII characters for this program to function.
A description of each cipher is in the files in the doc directory.

---- Usage ----

Usage: ./PA1 <"B" or "S"> <input file> <output file> <keyfile> <"E" or "D">

For the first argument a B tells the program to encrypt/decrypt using the block cipher.  This cipher
requires that the key is exactly 8 characters long (this includes newlines).

By contrast, a S will use the stream cipher in which a key of any size and at least one character
can be used.

The last argument informs the program if the input file is to be encrypted or decrypted.

---- Compiling ----

Run "make" in the project root directory.  A file name "PA1" will be in the root directory and can
be run as described above.

---- Testing ----
Run "make test"  If there is any error make will return with an error code along with the error
